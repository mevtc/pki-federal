# Publishing to GitHub

This project is maintained on an internal GitLab instance (`repo.mevtc.com`) and
selectively published to GitHub (`github.com/mevtc/federal-pki`).

The `github-release` branch is the public-facing branch. It is pushed to GitHub
as `main`. Not all commits from the internal `main` branch need to be published.

## Remotes

```
origin  → repo.mevtc.com/mevtc/federal-pki   (internal)
github  → github.com/mevtc/federal-pki        (public)
```

If the `github` remote is not configured:

```bash
git remote add github git@github.com:mevtc/federal-pki.git
```

## Publishing Changes

1. Switch to the release branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout github-release
   ```

2. Bring in changes from `main` — either all of them or specific commits:
   ```bash
   # Everything since last sync:
   git merge main

   # Or specific commits only:
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```

3. Verify CI passes locally:
   ```bash
   ruff check . && ruff format --check .
   mypy federal_pki
   pytest --tb=short
   ```

4. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push github github-release:main
   ```

5. Push the updated branch back to GitLab:
   ```bash
   git push origin github-release
   ```

6. Return to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

## Handling GitHub Contributions

When an external contributor opens a PR on GitHub:

1. Review and merge the PR on GitHub (this updates `github-release` on GitHub)
2. Pull the changes locally:
   ```bash
   git fetch github
   git checkout github-release
   git pull github main
   ```
3. Cherry-pick into internal `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Push the updated `github-release` to GitLab:
   ```bash
   git push origin github-release
   ```
